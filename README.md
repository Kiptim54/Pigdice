## Description

This is pig dice game.
##### These are the instructions:
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

## BDD specs:
* Ensure that there are two players:
* Create constructor that stores all the player and their scores
* when a player rolls the dice generate a random number
  input: click dice
  output: Math.floor(Math.random() (times)6+1);
* if random number is 1 they lose all their accumulated dice rolls, else the total dice rolls are added to total score.
* First player to get a total score of 100 wins the game
